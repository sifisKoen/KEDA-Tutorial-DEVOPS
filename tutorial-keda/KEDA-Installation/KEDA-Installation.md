# Install KEDA

First of all we will need to install KEDA to our system.

We will use the following command witch will _apply_ the **KEDA** official yaml file from KEDA's github repository.

```cmd
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kedacore/keda/releases/download/v2.4.0/keda-2.4.0.yaml
```

> For more information and more ways on how to install KEDA, we strongly suggest to visit the official page so to read more: [KEDA]
