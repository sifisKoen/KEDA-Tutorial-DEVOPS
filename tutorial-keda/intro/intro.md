## Prerequisite

- Basic knowledge of linux command line
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes
- Basic knowledge of Docker
- And willing for knowledge!

For this tutorial you need to know what is Kubernetes. Because KEDA is a tool for Kubernetes witch helps for scaling workloads, based on event driven metrics.

## Why you should care about KEDA

KEDA can be used in multiple ways in multiple applications like, edge applications, or in big scale scenarios where the workload is unpredictable. So you can use KEDA to scale-out the Kubernetes cluster.

## Learning outcomes

In this tutorial you will learn the following topics.

- Create and upload a docker container to docker hub.
- Deploy an application in Kubernetes cluster.
- Make the application exposed to real world.
- Run and configure a Prometheus instance.
- Connect Prometheus with KEDA tool (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling).
- Test you web page with K6 load testing.

### Don't forget

When you finish the tutorial, don't forget to read the special file. `ls` and `cat` commands will help you. ðŸ˜…
